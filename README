This project is for numerical simulation of acoustic and elastic waves. 
It is used in academic research in Geophysical field. 


The codes contains two parts. One is for acoustic wave simulation, and 
the other one is for elastic wave simulation. Both are 2d version 
currently.  It is realized by finite difference method and The difference 
stencil is two-order in time and high order in space. The boundary is 
well-known Perfect Match layer (PML) boundary.
